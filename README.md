## Description
We have decided to create a simple HOSPITAL database for maintaining information regarding <b>Patients</b>,  <b>doctors</b> and <b>wards</b> in a hospital environment, as well as the ways these entities are related to one another. The database contains 5 tables such as Patient, Ward, Doctor, Treats, Works_For and 2 extra tables: Users and Logging which help keep track of the people handling the database. The GUI allows non specialist users to manage the system in an organized way.

The following are the actions users can carry out in the system

* Carry our CRUD on the information of a doctor, ward, patient or a user
* Add/Delete <b>treatments</b> which link doctor and patient.
* Assign/Release doctor to <b>work for</b> a ward.
* View patients residing in a specific ward.
* View patients being treated by a specific doctor.
